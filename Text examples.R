## Preamble ####
# The following script is a "port" of Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson (2nd
#  edition) to R. (Well, at least it is a port of most of it.)
# In a couple locations, I have used fread() to open ".dat" files, which is
#  a common network file format. I have also included a couple functions to
#  read basic UCINET files, which are also a common format. However, I think
#  that all the data are also included as .CSV files; I ported the data from
#  various sources.
#
# This isn't in "package" form because I want you to have the code, and
#  not just the output. (I don't know if you knew this, but you can
#  get the code for any function by typing the function name without the
#  parentheses at the console, and then pressing "Enter". But I wanted
#  to make it easier for you.)
#
# This was prepared/updated for use by GDAT 622 students at
#  St. John Fisher College; hence, the comments about what is
#  known or not known apply to that audience.
#

## Preparation ####

#
# There are several other potentially useful packages, including:
#   CINNA - 
#   gplot -
#   ggnetwork - ggplot-like plotting for networks
#   graphlayouts - Some useful plotting stuff for igraph
#   keyplayer - advanced centality methods
#   multiplex - for multplex graphs
#   ndtv - Network Dynamic Temporal Visualization
#   qgraph
#   RSiena - particularly useful for longitudinal networks; see Snijders' 
#            Siena home page
#   sand - from a more mathematical text
#   tnet - miscellaneous advanced analyses
#   vegan - Some useful network and clustering functions
# They are mostly beyond the scope of this course, however, and so are not
#  included here.

{
  c("alphahull",     # To calculate the convex hull
    "ca",            # Correspondence analysis
    "conflicted",    # To deal with conflicting function names
    # I've had some strangeness with this
    #  script. I suspect package:conflicted,
    #  but I don't yet know for sure.
    "data.table",    # Fast data input/output
    "dplyr",         # This is all of tidyverse that gets used here
    "dtplyr",        # dplyr syntax with a data.table backend
    "here",          # To find/store files w/o setwd() and getwd()
    "igraph",        # Basic network tools; we'll use statnet mostly
    "igraphdata",    # Some useful datasets
    "intergraph",    # Translate between igraph and statnet formats

## Reading UCINET files ####
# package:rucinet used to read UCINET files, but UCINET has changed their
#  format, so that the rucinet package no longer works. However, I found some
#  other code, modified it - so we have access to the read.ucinet.header() 
#  and read.ucinet() functions - and include it here.

# A Note about plotting:
# Generic network plotting has a random aspect to it, so setting the seed
#  helps to make it reproducible. There are a number of ways to layout the
#  nodes on a network, and we'll look at some of those, but network plotting
#  is still a bit of an art and a bit of luck.
# Tcl/Tk can be used to set the position of nodes by hand, but OMG, what a
#   pain!
#
# All that is the long explanation for why the plots here will not necessarily
#  look exactly like those in the text.
# 
# More on plotting will happen in Chapter 7.

# Imputing (Section 5.4.2)
# First off, you know how I feel about imputing data
# Second, the way that UCINET imputes data is wrong (because
#  there is no good way to impute networked data; imputing
#  data when the samples are not independent is really, really
#  really hard - infinitely harder than doing a good job of
#  imputing non-networked data).
# Third, this is UCINET specific stuff, so I won't do it here
#
# Matrix 5.2
# Matrix 5.3

# Symmetrizing - some analyses need this
# The way to do it is to work with the matrices:
(F5.10_mat + t(F5.10_mat))/2 -> symmetrized_mat
symmetrized_mat
# In addition, sna::symmetrize() will sorta do this type of thing,
#  but you need to give it a "rule". Look at the help file for more
#  information.

# Dichotomizing
# Make the all binary (i.e., drop the weights)
# The easiest thing to do is just ignore the weights. However, if
#  one works with a matrix, then this works:

# Figure 8.7
# Well, if I knew which data were being used, I'd do this one.
# However, BEJ are really using this example simply to 
#  demonstrate the differences between resampling approaches
#  to p-values and the classical approaches to p-values. I
#  believe that you already know this one, so no loss.

# Sections 8.7 and 8.8
# ERGM and SAOM are handled much differently in R than in UCINET.
#  Hence, trying to just recreate the figures here is not only
#  frustrating for the instructor, it is likely to be of limited
#  help. See the appropriate folders in the Blackboard course site

# Looking at the UCINET help (online) for "Data Affiliations" gives this:
# "Converts an m´n matrix to an m´m or n´n by forming AA'  or A'A using two

# That's just what we did. However, they also say:
# 
# "The routine also allows for the final matrix to be normalized to accommodate
#  the different sizes of the events. Consider two actors i and j and let X be
#  the product of the number events they both attended and the number of events
#  they both did not attend, let Y be the product of the number events i 
#  attended and j did not with the number of events j attended and i did not. 
#  If X=Y the normalized entry is 0.5 otherwise it is (X-SQRT(XY))/(X-Y)."
#
# The last part is how to normalize this stuff. For the original matrix
#  Events both attended: sum(row(i) * row(j)) = both
#  Events both did not attend: number of columns - both
#  i attended without j = sum(row(i)) - both
#  j attended without i = sum(row(j)) - both
# After doing all this, then normalize to 100.
