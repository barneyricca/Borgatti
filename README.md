# Borgatti
R files to recreate the examples in Borgatti, Everett, and Johnson (2nd edition). These are provided "as is" but hopefully will be of use to you.

"Text examples.R" contains all the code.

The necessary data can be downloaded from either the Data folder or Data.zip. Almost all of these datasets are from http://study.sagepub.com/borgatti2e, but many have been converted from UCINET format to .CSV (or other) format, so that they can be more easily used with R/RStudio.

When you find a (better) way to do any of these things, pull requests are welcomed!

Notes:

2020-05-24: Added the "Scientific Collaborations" to the Data directory.

2020-05-26: Add the attributes for the "Scientific Collaboraitons" to the Data directory.
